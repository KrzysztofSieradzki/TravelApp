    <h2 id="general_info">General info</h2>
    <p>Application has been created to collect all countries in the World map as our achievements.
    Project was inspired by the 'Scratch-map', extended by personal information about voyager and yet few useful aspects.
    Each user has a rank which can improve by adding new checked countries. Except already visited places, user can add
    countries which user would like to see in the future. Additional feature is possibility to see general
    information about each country on the World. For these users who like prepare list of items to pack before trip,
    there is a possibility to create this kind of check-list for planned adventures in the future.
